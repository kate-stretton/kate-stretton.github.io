        <h3>The relationship between HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
          On a webpage, HTML defines the structure, CSS provides the style, and JavaScript deals with interactivity. The DOM is the means through which JavaScript interacts with the content on the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like to use the analogy of a house when thinking about HTML, CSS and JavaScript fit together. HTML represents the frame of a house, and the rooms, furnishings and appliances within it. CSS represents the interior design of the house - the colour of the walls, and the arrangement and styling of the furnishings. Finally, JavaScript represents the electrical wiring and plumbing within the house, ensuring that turning on a switch/tap provides light/water.
        </p>
        <h3>Control flow and loops</h3>
        <p>
          Control flow refers to the order in which code is run. Generally, code is run line by line from the top to the bottom. However, this can be manipulated by using conditional statements and loops. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Conditional statements check to see if a certain condition is true or false, and then select a way forward depending on the outcome. Loops repeat an action or a sequence of actions a predetermined number of times. 
        </p>
        <p>
          An everyday example of this would be making cups of tea for your flatmates. Along the way, conditionals would include checking whether more water needed to be added to the jug before boiling it, and checking if there were enough tea bags. A loop would include preparing a cup of tea for each individual flatmate. 
        </p>
        <h3>Interacting with the DOM</h3>
        <p>
          The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. The DOM is created when a new webpage is loaded, and presents documents in a logical structure that visually resembles a tree. It makes it possible for a website’s files to access each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          The DOM is the means by which JavaScript accesses and manipulates elements on a page. An example of how you might interact with the DOM is finding an HTML element and then saving it as a variable. 
          </p>
          <h3>Accessing data from arrays and objects</h3>
          <p>
            In Javascript, arrays and objects are used to store data. An object represents a ‘thing’ with characteristics - like a person, animal or piece of furniture.  The characteristics are called properties and consist of a key and a value. An array is a type of object - it stores an ordered list of values in a single variable. Each value in the ordered list is represented by an index and begins with an index of 0.
          </p>
            <p>
              You can access the properties in an object using dot notation with the key. An example is included below:
            </p>
            <p>
              You can access values in an array and manipulate using indexes. An example is included below: 
            </p>
            <h3>Functions</h3>
            <p>
              A function is a sequence of instructions for performing a specific task. For the sequence of instructions to constitute a function, there must be input and output. Functions are useful because they allow you to reuse code. You can perform the same task multiple times and in different contexts without having to repeat the code.</p>
              <p>
                A function is declared using the keyword ‘function’, followed by the name of the function and then any parameters separated by commas in parentheses. The instructions are added within the body of the function:
              </p>
              <p>A function needs to be called to execute the instructions:</p>
