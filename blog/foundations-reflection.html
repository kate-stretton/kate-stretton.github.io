        <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>I've learned to accept that my confidence will fluctuate endlessly. </li>
            <li>I've learned that I'm very</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
        <P>
          It's important to remember you're values when things become challenging.
        </p>
        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          The content covered in sprint 4 has been the most helpful for me. I'm not someone who enjoys the learning process
        </p>
        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          The most challenging part of core learning has been writing and publishing the blog posts within a limited timeframe. My background is in writing, and I value taking the time to draft, rewrite and review writing before publishing it. However, this can absorb more time than I have and can err towards perfectionism. I've had to accept that 
        </p>
        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? </h3>
        <p>
          I definitely don't think the core content is a waste of time. Having spent some time working in the tech industry I understand how important these skills are and why more people should be taught them. However, as someone who is prone to overthinking things, I've found that there's such a thing as too much self-reflection at times. In many ways the last few weeks for me have been about learning to accept that there are lots of things I don't understand yet, and that it will become clearer in time - whether or not I dwell on it endlessly.
