        <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>I've learned to accept that my my level of confidence will be in flux for a while. I find I oscillate between thinking I fully understand some concepts and then thinking I don't understand them at all. I've decided it's best not to worry about this too much, an instead just focus on learning as much as I can as I go.</li>
            <li>I've been reminded that it's quite difficult for me to learn new technical concepts without much context. This was really apparent to me during Sprint 3 when I had limited understanding of how things like 'loops' were relevant. Learning to stick to the content and trust that everthing will fall into place later on has been helpful, although sometimes easier said than done.</li>
            <li>I've become better at embracing the word 'yet'. Learning new skills takes time, and it takes even more time to master them. I'm not an inherently patient person, but realise that learning to code, even at breakneck speed, requires patience.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
        <P>
          I find learning to code very challenging. Akthough I'm really enjoying it, it feels a bit relentless at times and isn't without struggle. I think it's important to reflect on your values when you take on sometihng difficult because it's a good reminder of what's important to you and what led you to where you are. The benefit of taking on a challenge like this with a group is that you're not alone - there are many others who are similarly placed. A shared understanding of this in conjunction with some self-awareness means that you can both provide and accept help. 
        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          I was surprised by some of the things I learned while researching neuroplasiticy and mindset. The brain's ability to adapt and change is amazing. Given the volume of content we need to get through in the coming months, it was reassuring to learn more about this.
        </p>
        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          The most challenging part of core learning has been writing and publishing the blog posts within a limited timeframe. My background is in writing, and I value taking the time to draft, rewrite and review writing before sharing it. However, doing so can absorb more time than I have and can err towards perfectionism. I've had to accept that writing perfect blog posts is not the main objective of the course, and learn to be content with what I can come up with in the allocated period of time. 
        </p>
        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
        <p>
          Learning a lot of information quickly is hard. Doing so successfully relies on you managing your emotions, and communicating with and being aware of others in the cohort. Outside the course itself, these are also skills that are valued in the tech industry. Being an expert coder is great, but you need a wider skillset.
        </p>
        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? </h3>
        <p>
          I don't think the core content is a waste of time. Having spent some time working in the tech industry I understand how important these skills are and why more people should be taught them. However, as someone who is prone to overthinking things, I've found that sometimes there's such a thing as too much self-reflection at times! It can be easy to spiral into reflecting on all the things I don't fully understand yet...
