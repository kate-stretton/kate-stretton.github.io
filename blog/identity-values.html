      <h1>Identity, values and strengths</h1>

      <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.
      </h3>
        <p>
         Ethical decisions are part of daily life. Sometimes the consequences of these decisions are extreme, and other times they are quite minor. Either way, it all comes down making a choice between right and wrong.

          Recently I went to my regular supermarket to collect some groceries. I purchased the groceries at the self-service checkout, but forgot to scan one of the items I was carrying. Unfortunately I didn't realise this until I got back to my car. I really didn't want to go back inside - it was an honest mistake, and a relatively inconsequential one for the supermarket. However I felt bad about it and went back in to pay for the item separately. It was somewhat awkward to explain to the checkout assistant.</p>
          <p>In part my decision was about alleviating my own guilt - I didn't want to feel bad every time I ate rice that week. But I do also think it's important to do the right thing even when it feels like it won't make that much difference either way.</p>
      <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
      <p>
        I grew up in rural New Zealand in a family that enjoyed adventure and the outdoors. I’ve carried this appreciation into adulthood and to this day it informs a lot of the decisions I make. I like to spend most of my spare time outdoors - either at the beach during summer, or in the mountains during winter - an enjoy staying active.</p>
        <p>
          Growing up rurally also highlighted the importance of community and the sense of belonging that comes with that. My family was actively involved in helping out in our local community and taking care of others, and they instilled these values in me. I think it becomes harder to find a sense of community as you grow older. Instead of falling back on communities you fall into at school and university, you have to actively seek out groups of people with whom you have something in common. I’ve been lucky to find this through team sports, shared interests and also workplaces.

      <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
      <p>
        Learning new skills and working productively both require quite a lot of self-awareness. I try to work with my strengths and limitations rather than against them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have the Myer Briggs personality type INFJ. My DiSC workplace assessment of "C Style" is consistent with this. I find personality profiles like these both interesting and helpful in so much as they inform me of things about myself that I probably couldn’t have come up with on the spot, but which I know to be true. Some of my strengths are approaching thins logically, and valuing accuracy and precision. Some limitations that I'm conscious of are my time management skills and struggles with decision making.
        </p>
      <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
      <p>
        Being logical, accurate and precise has helped me in my career to date, and has likely also contributed to my new interest in learning programming. I think these skills will help me approach problem-solving and work through the content for each sprint in a methodical and thorough way.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, these strengths can also lend themselves quite well to letting time get away from me and avoiding making decisions.  I recognise that in the coming months I’ll need to actively manage these limitations.
      </p>
      <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
      <p>
        I previously worked in a job where I was required to collaborate with lots of different parts of the business to write documentation. On occasion, there would be differing views on how to approach something. This was to be expected because everyone had a different perspective and a different set of priorities. Working through these issues came down to good communication, a bit of negotiation and some compromise. I learned over time that it's important to find out why people hold the views that they do. I also got better at explaining my own point of view and advocating for that.
