    <h3>Solving a simple problem</h3>

      <p>
        This week I got stuck on problem that seemed simple to begin, but proved to be more complex than I'd thought. It involved writing a function to find out which door Scooby Doo was hiding behind. I initially wrote out some general steps in pseudocode and made a couple of first attempts, and then realised I hadn't fully understood the challenge to begin with. The part I was confused about was where the information about which door Scooby was actually behind was coming from. I was a little late in realising that I could reveal this information using console.log.

         After a period of trial and error, I spent some time Googling the method I was supposed to be using. I then reviewed the sample solution and tried to work through and make sense of the logic. Unable to find a solution, and feeling quite frustrated, I decided to take a break. While doing so, I discussed the problem with my flatmate who conveniently had some knowledge of JavaScript. She was able to offer a bit of guidance which helped me understand what the question was actually asking. While I wasn't successful in writing an alternative solution to the sample one provided, I did manage to piece the code together and make sense of it. In doing so, I learned more about arrays, the find method and also arrow functions.

      <h3>An elegant solution</h3>

       <p>
         A problem that I felt I solved elegantly was using the split() and filter() methods to remove several instances of the word 'buzz' from a sentence. This problem directly followed the challenging one outlined above. After the difficulty I'd encountered with Scooby Doo, it was reassuring to realise that I actually knew where to start with this one.

        I wrote out some pseudocode and decided that my approach would be quite similar to that of another challenge I'd completed earlier on. I spent some time Googling the methods, and then made an initial attempt. Much to my delight, my first attempt was not far off a good solution. I had to spend some time working out how to overcome an issue with capital letters, but was able to draw on my knowledge from previous challenges. It felt great to know that something I'd learned previously could be applied in another context.

    <h3>Techniques and processes</h3>
      <p>
       The frequency with which I come up against problems while learning to code means that it's helpful to have a number of different problem solving techniques up my sleeve. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Pseudocode</b> - writing some pseudocode is always a great starting point for me. Breaking down the different steps I think might be required to solve a problem and then writing them out helps me think things through fully. Sometimes I find I need to go back and make adjustments to the order of my pseudocode, or that I've missed an important step out. Regardless of whether I get it right first time, I find the process very helpful.</li>
        <li><b>Rubber ducky method</b> - while I'm yet to use this method to talk through my code out loud, I have successfully used a written variation of the process. When I get stuck, I typically write out a description in my notes app of the issue I'm trying to solve, and the code I've written out thus far - kind of like emailing the Rubber Ducky. This approach has largely been because I've been working in a library where it wasn't possible to discuss the issue out loud.</li>
        <li><b>Reading error messages</b> - I'm less confident when it comes to reading error messages. Sometimes I find the error mesage helpful, and other times I struggle to work out what I've done wrong. This is something I'll keep working on.</li>
        <li><b>Console.logging</b>- I initially struggled to understand the purpose of console.log. I was aware it was important, but it felt very abstract to me. Its value has become much clearer to me over the last sprint and I'm now much better at realising when it would be helpful to see the output of my code.</li>
        <li><b>Googling</b> - after writing some pseudocode and making a first attempt, I always spend some time Googling the concept. In many ways Google is my best firend, but I've also found that it's quite easy to get lost down a rabbit hole, so try to keep my searches focused on the problem at hand.</li>
        <li><b>Asking for help</b> - for me it's really important to fully understand the question I have when I ask for help. I like to first spend time looking into the problem myself so that I know what I don't know. Once I have clearly defined question, I love taking them to experts. That said, I've found a lot of the questions that come up tend to have been previously asked by other students, and I can usually find an answer in a thread on Discord.</li>
        <li><b>Improving your process with reflection</b> - increasingly I've been trying to leave more comments alongside my code. This helps me remember the thought process I followed when I go back over what I've done. I do think that I'll see more of the benefits of reflection later on in the course when I have a bit more knowledge and context.</li>
