       <h3>About class and ID selectors</h3>
     <p>In CSS, selectors are used to identify HTML elements on a webpage and apply specific styles to each element. The two most commonly used selectors are class selectors and ID selectors.</p>
     <h3>Id selectors</h3>
     <p>ID selectors are unique. You can use them to define a style rule and then apply that rule to a single HTML element. They also make it possible to navigate to different parts of a webpage. You’ll see ID selectors written as a hashtag followed by the name of the ID selector. The name should be short but descriptive, and should help users understand your code. Here's an example of an ID selector:</p>
     <pre>
      <code>
        #header { 
          color: red;
          font: 20px;
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <h3>Class selectors</h3>
     <p>Class selectors are not unique. You can use them to define a style rule and apply it to multiple HTML elements. You’ll see class selectors written as a full stop followed by the name of the class selector. As with ID selectors, it’s best to choose a name that provides helpful context. Here's an example of a class selector:</p>
     <pre>
      <code>
        .grid { 
          display: grid;
          color: red;
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <h3>Best practice</h3>
     <p>When writing formatting HTML, ID selectors and class selectors can often be used interchangeably. However, it’s best practice to use ID selectors to style single elements and class selectors to style multiple elements. For example, you should use an ID selector to apply a unique style to a single heading, and a class selector to format multiple paragraphs of text in the same way.</p>
     <p>Understanding the distinction between ID selectors and class selectors helps you control the layout and design of your page. As ID selectors are also used later on in JavaScript, it’s advantageous to use them correctly and form good habits from the outset.</p>
