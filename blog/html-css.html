     <p>In CSS, selectors are used to identify HTML elements on a webpage and apply specific styles to each element. The two most commonly used selectors are class selectors and ID selectors.</p>
     <p>ID selectors are unique. You can use them to define a style rule, and then apply that rule to a single HTML element. They also provide a way to navigate around a webpage. In CSS you’ll see ID selectors displayed as a hashtag followed by the name of the ID selector. The name should be short but descriptive, and should help users understand your code. Here's an example of an ID selector:</p>
     <pre>
      <code>
        #header { 
          color: red;
          font: 20px;
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
     <p>Class selectors are not unique. You can use them to define a style rule and apply it to multiple HTML elements. In CSS you’ll see them displayed as a full stop followed by the name of the class selector. As with ID selectors, it’s best practice to choose a name that provides helpful context. Here's an example of a class selector:</p>
     <pre>
      <code>
        .grid { 
          display: grid;
          color: red;
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
     <p>When writing formatting HTML, ID selectors and class selectors can often be used interchangeably. However, it’s best practice to use ID selectors to style single elements and class selectors to style multiple elements. For example, you should use an ID selector to apply a unique style to a single heading, and a class selector to format multiple paragraphs of text in the same way.</p>
     <p>Understanding the distinction between ID selectors and class selectors helps you control the layout and design of your page. As ID selectors are also used later on in JavaScript, it’s advantageous to form good habits from the outset.</p>
