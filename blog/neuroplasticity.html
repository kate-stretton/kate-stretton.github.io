    <h3>The principles of neuroplasticity</h3>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity describes the brain’s ability to change from and adapt to different experiencess. Historically researchers believed that the brain was static and that there was little change to neurons beyond birth. This is now understood to be incorrect. The consensus amongst researchers is that the brain is malleable and new connections and new neurons are created on an ongoing basis. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Children experience rapid brain growth as they learn and gain new experiences. As adults this happens at a slower rate, but we continue to strengthen some connections, build new ones and eliminate others. <i>Functional plasticity</i> takes place when damage occurs, resulting in functions moving from one part of the brain to another. <i>Structual plasticity</i> refers to change to the physical structure of the brain, and stems from learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        The principles of neuroplasticity apply when learning and practicing new skills. These will be very important in the coming months while I continue to learn to code - I'll be practicing coding everyday, and keeping in mind that using this new knowledge daily will help me retain information and continuously improve. Being specific and repeating exercises will also help to strengthen my understanding.

    <h3>Increasing neuroplasticity</h3>
      <p>
        According to<a href="https://accelerate.uofuhealth.utah.edu/resilience/neuroplasticity-how-to-use-your-brain-s-malleability-to-improve-your-well-being">Accelerate Learning Community</a>there are five components to neuroplastic change:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Change & novelty</li>
          <li>Intention</li>
          <li>Specific attention</li>
          <li>Repetion &i ntensity</li>
          <li>Time</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        To increase neuroplasticity, it's important to work with these five components in mind. Generally speaking, neuroplasticity is also improved through enriching experiences like learning new skills, exploring new places and pursuing creative endeavours. Along side tis it can be enhanced by taking time to rest and exercise regularly.

    <h3>The relevance of growth mindset</h3>
      <p>
        Growth mindset refers to the idea that an individual’s abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work. Natural ability, while advantageous, doesn’t dictate an individual’s ability to succeed.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think it's really important to be reminded of this because mindset has a profound effect on the way we view and respond to failure. A growth mindset encourages lends itself to taking on new challenges and persevering when things get tough. Conversely, a fixed mindset limits our belief in what we're capable of, and makes it harder to go on in the face of adversity. I've been surprised by how much I've learned over the past few weeks, and I attribute that in part to keeping an open mind. I think I could become good at programming in time and with practice. That said, it’s definitely not something that comes naturally to me from the outset, so I anticipate it will get harder before it gets easier. 
        </p>
    <h3>Integrating a growth mindset</h3>
      <p>
        As things become more difficult over the reaminder of the course, I'll need to work on cultivating and maintaining a growth mindset. My approach to integrating that with my learning journey will include: 
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Acknowleding that it's completely normal to struggle during the learning process.</li>
          <li>Embracing the word 'yet' - if I haven't yet mastered something, I just need to spend more time practicing!</li>
          <li>Remembering that mistakes are great learning opportunities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As part of my interest and focus on this, I've purchased Carol Dweck's book 'Mindset'. I'm looking forward to reading this and learning more about the benefits of a growth mindset.
