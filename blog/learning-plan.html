    <main>
      <h3>Foundations</h3>
      <h4>Goals</h4>
      <p>
        I find tech a really creative and dynamic industry to be a part of. I’m undecided on exactly what I want to do after Dev Academy, but know that I want to keep working in this industry. I really loved my previous job as a technical writer and would be interested in using my new skills to write for a developer audience. That said, I'm also considering having a go at finding work as a junior developer. 
      </p>
      <h4>Strengths and limitations</h4>
      <p>
        I love learning new skills and am excited to have the opportunity to focus on that over the next few months. I work well with clearly defined objectives and expectations, and am finding the structure of the course well suited to my learning style. I'm conscious that I'll need to actively manage some of my limitations in the coming months - in particuar my tendency to get lost in the detail and waste time perfecting things that don't need perfecting.
      </p>
      <p>
        A non-technical skill that I'd like to work on and turn into a strength is breaking down problems into smaller, more manageble sized tasks. I find it overwhelming when there are lots of parts to a problem and I sometimes have difficulty knowing where to start.
      </p>
      <h4>Workload and expectations</h4>
      <p>
        My understanding is that the coming months will involve a very heavy workload. I can already see how easy it is to spend more time learning about something than you should. I'll be monitoring my time with the Toggl Track app to make sure I don't get behind and take regular breaks. </p>
        <p>
          I don’t like letting things build up so plan to stick to the sprint schedule, and make time to check in with a facilitator if anything starts to become overwhelming. Working and studying remotely can sometimes feel a bit isolating, so it’s great to know that there’s a large group of people available on Discord to help whenever needed. My expectation of of the facilitation team is that they create a supportive and encouraging space where everyone feels like they can find the help they need.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m lucky to be in a position where I don’t have scheduled commitments that will interfere with my allocated study time. That said, I think it’s important to set some boundaries and take breaks. I’ll set aside some time each day for a lunch break and make sure I go outside and get some fresh air and do some exercise. 
      </p>
      <h3>Bootcamp</h3>
      <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>
      <p>
        I remain interested in combining my technical writing background with some new coding skills. However, I've been thinking more and more about looking into graduate/junior developer opportunities when Bootcamp is over. I think a good starting point for this could be Summer of Tech, but I'm trying to remain open minded.
      </p>
      <h4>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h4>
      <p>
        During Bootcamp, my biggest strength will be that I’m genuinely enjoying learning how to code. It’s always easier to do something challenging when you find it enjoyable and rewarding. 
      </p>
      <h4>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h4>
      <p>
        I think one of my bigger limitation will be that sometimes I struggle to figure out what I don’t understand. This ties in with what I outlined in my foundations learning plan, and my tendency to get lost in the details. I'll be focusing on making sure this doesn't prevent me from asking for help.
      </p>
      <h4>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
      <p>
        Something I'm expecting to find challenging is remote peer programming. I've spent the last few weeks problem solving by myself, so it will be quite a big change to start doing that with others. I'd like to work on the non-technical skills involved in solving problems with others - communicating with them and taking their ideas on board rather relying on working through it alone.
      </p>
      <h4>
        What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team and of yourself?
      </h4>
      <p>
        My expectations of the team and of myself haven't changed. My approach will be similar while taking into account that Bootcamp is more structured and also more intense.
