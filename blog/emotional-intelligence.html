         <h3>What is emotional intelligence?</h3>
         <p>
          Emotional intelligence describes an individual's awareness of their own emotions and those of others. The term encompasses a skillset that is learned and refined over time. Those with heightened emotional intelligence take the time to listen, empathize and reflect.

          <h3>How is emotional intelligence different from cognitive IQ?</h3>
          <p>
          While emotional intelligence is about perception, control and expression, IQ refers to an individual’s cognitive ability. It measures skills in reasoning as well as processing and remembering information. IQ is measured using standardized intelligence testing, and was historically considered an accurate way of measuring an individual’s overall intelligence and likelihood of success. Modern research indicates IQ scores don’t reflect an individual’s overall ability.

          <h3>Why is emotional intelligence important?</h3>
          <p>
          Emotional intelligence helps an individual regulate their response to the world around them and fully comprehend the perspective of others. These skills are crucial when it comes to navigating complex and dynamic scenarios.

          In a work context emotional intelligence plays an important role in leadership, communication, building relationships and problem solving. Outside of work, emotional intelligence is a driving factor in levels of happiness and motivation.
