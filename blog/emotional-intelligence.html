         <h3>What is emotional intelligence?</h3>
         <p>
          Emotional intelligence refers to an individual's awareness of their own emotions, and the emotions of those around them. Rather than remaining static, these skills are learned and refined over time. They influence interpersonal interactions, decision making and coping mechanisms. An important part of emotional intelligence is taking the time to listen, empathize and reflect.

          <h3>How is emotional intelligence different from cognitive IQ?</h3>
          <p>
          While emotional intelligence is about perception, control and expression, IQ refers to an individual’s cognitive ability. It measures skills in reasoning as well as processing and remembering information. IQ is measured using standardized intelligence testing, and was historically considered to be istrongly ndicative of an individual’s overall intelligence and likelihood of success. Modern research indicates IQ scores don’t reflect the breadth of an individual’s overall ability.
